			"Combining data about the user's experience while browsing the website with our website experience scoring algorithm, we will generate a detailed score for you that accurately reflects how good or bad the user's experience was while using the website. At the same time, we will also provide a detailed website experience report that lists the problems users encountered and the factors that affected their experience, including page loading speed, interface design and feature usability. This allows you to visualise your users' website experience and quickly pinpoint possible problems, increasing the efficiency of improving your website and enhancing the user experience.",
		title2: "Big Data Analysis",
		content2:
			"By counting and visualising the problems encountered in the website, we can get a better understanding of the site. We have collected a large amount of data on problems experienced by users, such as slow loading, unfriendly interface design, and unavailable features. By visualising this data, you can clearly see what the common problems are and which ones have the biggest impact on the user experience. In addition, we can analyse and visualise information about the origin of users, including country or region, device and browser. This information can help you understand your user base and optimise your website experience strategy.",
		title3: "Optimal Experience",
		content3:
			"Our experience reports will point out current website issues and provide best website experience practices to help you improve your website and enhance the user experience. We also share examples of successful web experiences, analysing their successful strategies and solutions to common problems to provide you with inspiration and reference. In this way, we hope to stimulate your creative thinking and enable you to succeed in delivering exceptional web experiences.",

		content5:
		    "We adjust the weight according to different users' concerns and expectations of the website experience, and flexibly adjust the weight of various aspects of the experience report. Through this module, we are able to more accurately reflect the needs of users and provide personalized experience reports. For example, if current users are more concerned about rendering speed and ease of use of the site, we can adjust the weight of these aspects in the experience report to better meet user expectations. This flexible weight adjustment mechanism allows us to provide more tailored experience reports for different users and different types of websites",
		title6:"Average level",
		content6:
		    "Evaluate and compare all aspects of the website experience based on extensive data aggregation and analysis. Through this module, we are able to compare the user's website experience with the industry average, helping users to better understand the performance advantages and room for improvement in different aspects of their website. Including but not limited to page loading speed, interactive response time, user interface design and other metrics. Then, compare these metrics with the corresponding industry or similar types of websites, calculate the average level of each aspect, and understand how their website is performing in all aspects"
